Code for the paper "On abelian varieties whose torsion is not self-dual" by Frei, Honigs and Voight

This repository contains Magma code verifying the numerical claims in the paper "On abelian varieties whose torsion is not self-dual" by Sarah Frei, Katrina Honigs and John Voight. In code-supporting-FHV, we verify the claims in Theorems 4.5.1, 5.1.1, and Remark 5.1.2. In all-nonselfdual-groups, we verify the claims in Proposition 5.2.4.
