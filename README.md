Code for the paper "On abelian varieties whose torsion is not self-dual" by Frei, Honigs and Voight

This repository contains Magma code verifying the computational claims in the paper "On abelian varieties whose torsion is not self-dual" by Sarah Frei, Katrina Honigs and John Voight. In code-supporting-FHV, we verify the claims in Theorem 1.2.1, Proposition 3.1.1, and Remark 3.1.2.  In all-nonselfdual-groups, we verify the claims in Proposition 3.2.5.
